A new paper has been published on arXiv: [E-Values for Exponential Families: the General Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11134v1).
Alongside our previous work, [Optimal E-Values for Exponential Families: the Simple Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19465), we have now presented comprehensive results concerning E-values in the context of exponential families.
