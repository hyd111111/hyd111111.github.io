I am a PhD student in mathematics and statistics at [Machine Learning group](https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/machine-learning/), [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) (the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands), under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Gr√ºnwald](https://safestatistics.com/).

My research interests include Safe, Anytime-Valid Test (Also called e-value, e-process etc.) and Information Theory with a focus on Minimum Description Length (MDL).
I am also interested in foundational problems in Machine Learning.
