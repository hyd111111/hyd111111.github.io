I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/), [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), where I work with [Dr. Kin Wai Chan](https://sites.google.com/site/kwchankeith/home). Before that, I was a PhD student in statistics at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/) (the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands) and obtained my Ph.D. at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en), under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Gr√ºnwald](https://safestatistics.com/).

My research interests include Anytime-Valid (Sequential) Test (Specifically e-value, e-process etc.), Information Theory with a focus on Minimum Description Length (MDL) and time series analysis. I am also interested in foundational problems in Machine Learning.
